This is an academic project developed over the x64 barebones OS.
The goal was to make a basic OS which was able to perform context switching and run a couple of programs, 
with the option to run two programs side by side without restarting the OS in case one of these generated an exception, 
that is, the OS should handle exceptions independently.
